##Applied Genomic Technologies(BENG183)

Project Summary:   We built a evaluation pipeline on how AlphaMissense works. AlphaMissense is an extenstion of AlphaFold which is a groundbreaking AI system developed by Google DeepMind  that is used to predict protein structure. It  builds upon the models and protein data already provided by AlphaFold. 

It  takes a missense variant as input and as its output, predicts its pathogenicity as being either “likely pathogenic”, “likely benign”, or “uncertain/ambiguous”. The pathogenicity score that users will interpret will be from a scale of 0 to 1, where 0.34 or lower corresponds to “likely benign”, 0.564 or higher to “likely pathogenic”, and in between is ambiguous. 

We introduced AlphaMissense, a newer AI tool in bioinformatics. We evaluated it’s performance, including how prediction accuracy varies across different structural groups. We worked on it’s data integration, practical applications, limitations and compared prior AI approaches similar to AlphaMissense. 

My Contributions:  I contributed across the project, with a primary focus on applications and limitations of AlphaMissense. The work was highly engaging and taught me how to evaluate AI tools rigorously such as what assumptions and biases to check and where models may fail (e.g., specific structural regions or missing biological context). I also mapped how these insights translate to real-world use cases from population genomics to prioritizing drug targets.
